# oSTEMHackathonTraining-InformationalPrideWebsite
This project's purpose is to train oSTEM members for the Hackathon occurring before the oSTEM conference in Boston. The example project will use the MERN stack to create a web app. This web app will be a place where people can upload useful LGBTQ+ related information regarding resources, LGBTQ+ history, and events going on in the community. Although this example project will be used for these purposes, members have the choice to follow the tutorial videos to repurpose this example project to create their own websites that can solve problems they are more interested in.
